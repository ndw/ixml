<h1>The First International Symposium on Invisible XML</h1>

<p>Invisible XML (ixml) is a language and process for identifying structure in
documents. Invisible markup allows users to exploit the implicit structures in
documents without the need for explicit markup.</p>

<p>Since the release of the ixml standard in 2022, we have seen a
steady increase in the use of ixml, as well as an abundance of
interesting conference presentations about the language.</p>

<p>The ixml community group therefore feels the time is right for an
event exclusively dedicated to ixml.</p>

<p>The Symposium will be held via Zoom on two afternoons (Western
European time): Thursday/Friday 26/27 February 2026. The sessions will
be four hours each day. </p>

<p>Attendance will be free.</p>

<p>Slides will be published on the ixml website after the Symposium,
along with videos of the presentations if these have been made
available.</p>

<h2 id="cfp">Call for presentations</h2>

<p>We invite proposals from new users and experts alike. Share your
experiences, techniques, ideas, implementations, use cases, grammars,
and anything else ixml-related.</p>

<p>Presentations will be by Zoom. Timeslots are flexible, from ten to
30 minutes in length, so presenters can judge how long their talk
requires.</p>

<p>Proposals should include a title, requested timeslot duration, and
summary (100–200 words).</p>

<p>There is no requirement for a written paper. Presenters will be
asked to submit a copy of their slides after the event. With presenter
permission, talks will be recorded and the videos published.</p>

<p>You can submit your proposals to
<a href="mailto:submit@invisiblexml.org">submit@invisiblexml.org</a>, on
or before 15 December, 2025.</p>

<p>Accepted presenters can contact the committee if they would like to
discuss or ask for advice about any aspect of their presentation.
Please contact the committee before 19 February to ensure that there
is time for discussion before the symposium.
</p>

<p>Presentations may not be written in whole or part by a large language model
(LLM); authors who make use of an LLM or other generative AI tool must sign a
statement that the tool has been trained on data acquired legally and with the
informed consent of its original creators; please contact
<a href="mailto:submit@invisiblexml.org">submit@invisiblexml.org</a>
if you have any queries about this policy.</p>
