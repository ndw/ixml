<h2>Call for Presentations</h2>

<p>We invite proposals from new users and experts alike. Share your
experiences, techniques, ideas, implementations, use cases, grammars,
and anything else ixml-related.</p>

<p>Presentations will be by Zoom. Timeslots are flexible, from ten to
30 minutes in length, so presenters can judge how long their talk
requires.</p>

<p>Proposals should include a title, requested timeslot duration, and
summary (100–200 words).</p>

<p>There is no requirement for a written paper. Presenters will be
asked to submit a copy of their slides after the event. With presenter
permission, talks will be recorded and the videos published.</p>

<p>You can submit your proposals to
<a href="mailto:submit@invisiblexml.org">submit@invisiblexml.org</a>, on
or before November 30, 2025.</p>

<p>We have recently noted that the use of large language models (LLMs)
and similar "generative AI" tools has become very common in talks
related to markup technologies. This symposium will apply two
requirements: </p>

<ol type="a">
<li>authors of any accepted proposal which makes use of an LLM or
other "generative AI" tool must sign a statement that the tool has
been trained on data acquired legally and with the informed consent of
its original creators;</li>
<li>talks must not be written, in whole or in part, by an LLM.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please get in touch with the committee on
<a href="mailto:submit@invisiblexml.org">submit@invisiblexml.org</a>
if you have any queries about this policy and how it might apply to
your submission.</p>

<p>Accepted presenters can contact the committee if they would like to
discuss or ask for advice about any aspect of their presentation.
Please contact the committee before 19 February to ensure that there
is time for discussion before the symposium.
